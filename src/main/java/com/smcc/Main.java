 * Languages Involed- Java,Gradle & Kotlin
 * This App Is a Simple Abstraction Of How AI is helpful in education.
 * We Did not go into any complicated logic like importing any basic AI models and stuff in a Python or C++ system(although Python is Preferable)
 * instead made some self-made systems for the project (basics) as a foundation to demonstrate how useful it can be.
 */

 /**
 * Our Goal With This Project Was To Show How AI Is Useful In Education. Not Only By The Means Of Interacting With It, While It Is Still In Development
 * With A Few Here and There Stuff, Such As It Can Solve Some Specific Math Problems And Physics Problems, Open Apps Like Facebook, Twitter,
 * Instagram ,YouTube Etc. On Our Default Browser. Not Only We Get To Learn And Experience More Of Programming Via This Gradle-Kotlin-Java Integrated
 * System While Making This AI, But The Ones Interacting Will Gain More Knowledge When They Try To Gather Knowledge From AI, Which We Tried To Potray
 * In A Very Simple Way.
