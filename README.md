🧠 Educational AI Assistant
👥 Developers
Saptansu Ghosh & Kajol Dey
🛠 Languages & Stack
- Java
- Kotlin
- Gradle

🎯 Project Goal
This project is a lightweight, self-built demonstration of how AI concepts can enhance education, especially without relying on complex imported AI models like those in Python or C++. Instead, we’ve crafted simple, custom-built logic to simulate real-world applications of AI within a Java/Gradle/Kotlin-integrated environment.
Our aim is to:
- Show the practical educational value of AI tools.
- Enable interactive learning through a smart assistant.
- Encourage deeper student engagement via accessible features.

⚙️ What It Can Do
- ✅ Solve math and physics problems via custom natural-language parsers
- ✅ Answer factual questions and FAQs about physics topics
- ✅ Launch applications (e.g., YouTube, Instagram, Facebook) in the default browser
- ✅ Play Minecraft sound effects as hidden easter eggs
- ✅ Offer basic system utility (open/close, registration logic, etc.)
