🎯 Project Goal
This project is a lightweight, developer-friendly demonstration of how AI-driven interaction can enrich education, built entirely using Java, Kotlin, and Gradle.
We intentionally avoided external AI model dependencies (like Python’s transformers or OpenCV), instead relying on hand-crafted logic and algorithms.
Our key objectives:
- Empower educational use-cases of AI in a fun, programmable way
- Offer natural, interactive learning for students
- Keep the system fully transparent and easy to extend

⚙️ Features Overview
- ✅ Natural Language Solving for Math and Physics word problems
- ✅ Answers theoretical queries using factual summaries (powered by Wikipedia)
- ✅ Launches websites like YouTube, Instagram, etc. using system browser
- ✅ Easter Eggs: Triggers Minecraft sound effects 🎵🎮
- ✅ Simple local authentication system (login & register)
