[1751148835452]:Velocity is the rate of change of displacement; it is a vector quantity that has both magnitude and direction.

Q: What is velocity?
A: Velocity is the rate of change of displacement; it is a vector quantity.

Q: How is velocity different from speed?
A: Speed is scalar (no direction), velocity is vector (includes direction).
